# Purchase Module Production-Ready Update Summary

## Overview
The purchase module has been completely rewritten to be production-ready with real-time functionality and dynamic data handling.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Fixed SQL Errors ✅
- **Problem**: SQL queries had missing FROM-clause entries for table aliases like `poi` and `po`
- **Solution**: Rewrote all queries using proper Drizzle ORM syntax with correct joins and aggregations
- **Impact**: All purchase endpoints now work without SQL errors

### 2. Removed Mock Data ✅
- **Problem**: Module was using fallback mock data when database queries failed
- **Solution**: Removed all mock/default data and implemented proper database queries
- **Impact**: System now uses only real data from the database

### 3. Database Schema Alignment ✅
- **Problem**: Database table structure didn't match TypeScript schema definitions
- **Solution**: Created migration to align database columns with schema expectations
- **Migrations**:
  - `fix-purchase-tables-schema.ts` - Fixed column names and structure
  - `clear-purchase-sample-data.ts` - Removed all sample data

### 4. Real-time WebSocket Integration ✅
- **Added**: Real-time broadcasting for all purchase operations
- **Events**: Creation, updates, status changes, approvals, rejections
- **Scope**: Suppliers, Purchase Requests, Purchase Orders
- **Implementation**: Proper WebSocket service integration throughout

### 5. Production-Ready Features ✅

#### Error Handling
