# ✅ Database Column Issue Fixed

## 🔧 Problem Identified and Resolved

**Issue**: SQL query was trying to select `u.company as user_company` from the users table, but the users table doesn't have a `company` column.

**Error**: `column u.company does not exist`

## 📋 Users Table Schema (Actual Columns)
From the database schema, the `users` table has these columns:
- `id`, `email`, `username`, `password`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `role`, `company_id`, `phone`, `job_title`, `profile_image`, `bio`, etc.

**Note**: There is NO `company` column in the users table.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

1. **Removed non-existent column from SQL query**:
   ```sql
   -- ❌ Before (causing error):
   u.company as user_company
   
   -- ✅ After (fixed):
   -- Removed the u.company reference entirely
   ```

2. **Updated user object creation**:
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Before:
   company: invoiceRow.user_company,
   
   // ✅ After:
   company: 'Your Company', // Default company name since users table doesn't have company column
   ```

## 🧪 Ready for Testing

The `column u.company does not exist` error should now be completely resolved!
