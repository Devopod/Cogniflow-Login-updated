# 🧾 Invoice Functionality Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### ✅ 1. Customer Details Not Visible
**Problem**: Invoice creation and detail pages weren't showing customer information properly.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing JOIN queries between invoices and contacts tables
- Frontend not properly handling contact data
- Some invoices had no customer assigned

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced all invoice API endpoints with proper customer data JOINs
- Updated invoice detail and list queries to include complete contact information
- Added automatic customer assignment for invoices without customers
- Improved frontend customer display logic

### ✅ 2. Email Functionality Not Production Ready
**Problem**: Email sending was failing with errors and wasn't suitable for production.

**Root Cause**:
- No email environment variables configured
- Poor error handling
- No fallback mechanisms
- Missing dependencies

**Solution Implemented**:
- Complete rewrite of email service with multiple provider support:
  - **Resend API** (primary, production-ready)
  - **SMTP** (fallback, supports Gmail/Outlook/etc.)
  - **Mock mode** (development/testing)
- Professional HTML email templates
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Automatic PDF attachment generation
- Payment link integration
