✅ 1. User Arrives at Landing Page (Public Site)
Purpose: Introduce your product, key features, and benefits.

This page includes navigation links, module highlights, and CTAs like “Explore HRMS”, “Start Free Trial”, or “Login”.

Each module (like Sales, Inventory, HRMS) should have a public-facing description page to explain its purpose.

🔗 Example URLs:

/

/modules/sales

/modules/hrms

🧠 Goal: Make it easy to understand what your ERP does before login.

✅ 2. User Clicks on a CTA (Explore or Start Demo)
Each module's CTA leads to either:

A dedicated landing page for that module (/modules/inventory)

OR directly to a login/signup page with the module intent stored in the URL (/login?redirect=/dashboard/inventory)

🧠 Why this matters: You preserve user intent so they land in the right place post-login.

✅ 3. Authentication Step (Login/Signup)
The login form captures user credentials.

Once login is successful:

The system generates a secure session or token

Fetches user permissions/roles from backend (e.g., can this user access HRMS?)

Then redirects to the appropriate module/dashboard

If the user clicked on “Explore HRMS” earlier, they now land on:

bash
Copy
Edit
/dashboard/hrms
🧠 Behavior: If a user tries to directly access /dashboard/sales without login or permission, redirect them to login or a “403 Forbidden” page.

✅ 4. Inside Authenticated ERP Panel (Dashboard)
Structure of this panel:

Common layout: navbar, sidebar, notifications

Sidebar dynamically shows only the modules allowed for the logged-in user

Each module like Sales, Inventory, HRMS has its own space

🎯 Example:

/dashboard/inventory

/dashboard/sales

/dashboard/reports

🧠 User Experience: Like a mini “operating system” inside your app. Each module feels like an app but shares the same design, login, and navigation.

✅ 5. Module Interaction
Each module allows users to:

View and manage data

Access reports or perform workflows (e.g., create invoice in Sales)

Trigger other modules (e.g., HRMS → Payroll)

Modules are independent in UX but may interconnect via backend APIs.

✅ 6. Returning to Public Site (Optional)
Users can logout or click on a link to return to the public site (e.g., “Back to Marketing Page” or /)

🧠 This separation keeps your marketing & technical systems clean.

🔐 Security and Structure Principles
Concept	How It Works
Public vs Auth Routing	Landing pages are open, dashboard is protected
Role-Based Access	Each user sees only modules they’re allowed to use
URL Deep Linking	Login preserves user’s intent and redirects correctly
Consistent Navigation	Sidebar inside dashboard is built dynamically per role
Unauthorized Access	Direct access without permission = redirect to login/403

🌍 Example Navigation Journey
User Action	URL Transition	What Happens
Lands on website	/	Sees product info
Clicks “Explore HRMS”	/modules/hrms	Sees HRMS benefits
Clicks “Try HRMS Now”	/login?redirect=/dashboard/hrms	Gets redirected after login
Logs in	/dashboard/hrms	Sees HRMS module UI if permitted
Tries accessing Sales (not permitted)	/dashboard/sales	Redirected to /403 or back to dashboard
Logs out	/logout → /	Back to public-facing site
