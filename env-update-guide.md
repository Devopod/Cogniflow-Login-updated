# 🔧 Update Your .env File

## Current Issues Found:

1. **Missing `FROM_EMAIL`** - Required for Resend
2. **Missing `APP_URL`** - Used in email templates
3. **Email might be going to spam** - Need to verify domain

## 📝 Add These Lines to Your .env File:

```bash
# Add these lines to your existing .env file:

# Required for Resend emails
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Application URL (for email links)
APP_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Session Secret (if not already set)
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-change-this-in-production
```

## 🚀 Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Open your `.env` file**
2. **Add the missing variables above**
3. **Restart your server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Test email**: Visit `http://localhost:5000/api/email/test`

## 📧 Why You're Not Receiving Emails:

### Option 1: Domain Verification (Most Likely)
- Resend requires domain verification for production emails
- Your `FROM_EMAIL` should be from a verified domain
- For testing, you can use Resend's sandbox domain

### Option 2: Spam Folder
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Gmail often filters emails from new senders

### Option 3: API Key Issues
- Your API key looks valid but might need domain setup

## 🔍 Test Your Email Configuration:

After updating your `.env`, test with:

```bash
# Test email configuration
curl http://localhost:5000/api/email/test

# Send test email
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/email/send-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"yashwanthkummagiri@gmail.com","subject":"Test Email","message":"Testing email configuration"}'
```

## 🎯 Recommended FROM_EMAIL for Testing:

For immediate testing, use:
```bash
FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

This is Resend's sandbox domain that works without verification.
