# Real-Time Invoice Processing System

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the real-time invoice processing system implemented in CogniFlow ERP. The system is designed to provide a Zoho-like experience with real-time updates, seamless user interactions, and robust data handling.

## System Architecture

### Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries

- **Relationships**: Properly defined foreign keys and constraints to maintain data integrity
- **Indexing**: Optimized indexes for fast retrieval of invoice and payment data

### Backend Layer
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for CRUD operations on invoices and payments
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication for instant updates
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication for all API requests
- **Business Logic**: Comprehensive invoice processing with status tracking, payment handling, and automatic calculations

### Frontend Layer
- **React Components**: Modular components for invoice display, editing, and payment processing
- **Real-Time Hooks**: Custom hooks for real-time data synchronization

## Implementation Details

### Invoice Data Structure
```typescript
interface Invoice {
  id: number;
  invoiceNumber: string;
  userId: number;
  contactId: number;
  issueDate: string;
  dueDate: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'pending' | 'partial' | 'paid' | 'overdue';
  subtotal: number;
  taxAmount: number;
  totalAmount: number;
  amountPaid: number;
  notes?: string;
  paymentTerms?: string;
  lastReminderSent?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  items?: InvoiceItem[];
}

interface InvoiceItem {
  id: number;
  invoiceId: number;
  description: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  taxRate?: number;
  amount: number;
}
```

### Payment Data Structure
```typescript
interface Payment {
  id: number;
  paymentNumber: string;
  userId: number;
  contactId: number;
  amount: number;
  paymentMethod: string;
  paymentDate: string;
  reference?: string;
  notes?: string;
  relatedDocumentType: 'invoice' | 'order' | 'other';
  relatedDocumentId?: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### WebSocket Message Types
1. **Invoice Updates**
   - `invoice_created`: New invoice created
   - `invoice_updated`: Invoice details updated
   - `invoice_deleted`: Invoice deleted
   - `status_changed`: Invoice status changed

2. **Payment Updates**
   - `payment_added`: New payment recorded
   - `payment_updated`: Payment details updated
   - `payment_deleted`: Payment deleted

3. **System Messages**
   - `connection_established`: WebSocket connection established
   - `error`: Error message

### API Endpoints

#### Invoices
- `GET /api/invoices`: Get all invoices for the authenticated user
- `GET /api/invoices/:id`: Get a specific invoice with items
- `POST /api/invoices`: Create a new invoice
- `PUT /api/invoices/:id`: Update an existing invoice
- `DELETE /api/invoices/:id`: Delete an invoice

#### Payments
- `GET /api/payments`: Get all payments for the authenticated user
- `GET /api/payments/:id`: Get a specific payment
- `GET /api/invoices/:id/payments`: Get all payments for a specific invoice
- `POST /api/payments`: Record a new payment
- `PUT /api/payments/:id`: Update an existing payment
- `DELETE /api/payments/:id`: Delete a payment

## User Experience Flow

### Invoice Creation
1. User navigates to the Invoices page
2. User clicks "New Invoice" button
3. User fills in invoice details (customer, items, dates, etc.)
4. System automatically calculates totals
5. User saves the invoice
6. System generates a unique invoice number
7. Real-time update is sent to all connected clients
8. Invoice appears in the list immediately

### Payment Processing
1. User views an invoice
2. User clicks "Record Payment" button
3. User enters payment details (amount, method, date, etc.)
4. System records the payment
5. System updates the invoice status based on payment amount
6. Real-time updates are sent to all connected clients
7. Payment appears in the history immediately
8. Invoice status and balance are updated in real-time

### Real-Time Collaboration
1. Multiple users can view the same invoice simultaneously
2. When one user makes a change, all users see the update in real-time
3. Payment notifications appear instantly
4. Status changes are reflected immediately
5. Activity log is updated in real-time

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All API endpoints and WebSocket connections require authentication
2. **Authorization**: Users can only access their own invoices and payments
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated on both client and server
4. **Data Sanitization**: All data is sanitized before storage and display
5. **HTTPS**: All communications are encrypted using HTTPS
6. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
2. **Connection Pooling**: Database connection pooling for better performance
3. **Caching**: Strategic caching of frequently accessed data
4. **Lazy Loading**: Components and data are loaded only when needed
5. **Pagination**: Large datasets are paginated to improve performance
6. **Targeted Updates**: WebSocket messages are sent only to relevant clients

## Future Enhancements
