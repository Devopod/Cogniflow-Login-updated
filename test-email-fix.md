# 🔧 Email Sending Fix - Database Query Issue Resolved

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Error**: `Cannot convert undefined or null to object` when sending invoice emails

**Root Cause**: The Drizzle ORM was having issues with `orderSelectedFields` function when trying to execute complex queries with undefined field mappings.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Replaced ORM Queries with Direct SQL**
- Changed from `storage.getInvoiceWithItems()` to direct SQL queries
- Eliminates ORM field mapping issues
- More reliable and predictable

### 2. **Enhanced Email Service**
- Direct SQL queries for all database operations  
- Custom email support (send to any email address)
- Robust error handling
- Fallback contact creation for missing customer data

### 3. **Simplified Activity Logging**
- Removed complex ORM calls that were causing issues
- Simple console logging for debugging
- No critical path dependencies

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Email Service (`server/src/services/email.ts`)
```typescript
// Before: Using ORM (causing errors)
const invoice = await storage.getInvoiceWithItems(invoiceId);
const contact = await storage.getContact(invoice.contactId);

// After: Using direct SQL (reliable)
const invoiceResult = await db.execute(sql`
  SELECT i.*, c.*, u.*
  FROM invoices i
  LEFT JOIN contacts c ON i.contact_id = c.id
  LEFT JOIN users u ON i.user_id = u.id
  WHERE i.id = ${invoiceId}
`);
```

### Storage Layer (`server/storage.ts`)
```typescript
// Simplified flow - delegates to email service
const result = await emailService.sendInvoiceEmail(invoiceId, {
  customMessage: emailOptions?.message,
  includePDF: true,
  customEmail: emailOptions?.email, // Custom email support
});
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. **Start the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Test Email Sending**
1. Create or open an invoice
2. Click "Send Email" button  
3. Enter any email address (custom email feature)
4. Add optional custom message
5. Click "Send Invoice"

### 3. **Expected Behavior**
- ✅ No more "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" errors
- ✅ Email sends successfully (shows in console logs if using mock mode)
- ✅ Professional email with payment link
- ✅ Status updates to "sent"
- ✅ Success notification appears

### 4. **Console Output (Success)**
```
🚀 Starting invoice email send for invoice 18
📧 Sending invoice to: customer@example.com (custom)
📧 MOCK EMAIL (Development Mode):
  To: customer@example.com
  Subject: Invoice INV-2025-0001 from Your Company
